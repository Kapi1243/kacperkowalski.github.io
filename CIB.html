        <h4 class="h5">Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h4>
        <p>The CIB project was a collaborative effort where my classmates and I created a fully functional website tailored to meet the needs of local businesses. Our goal was to provide a platform that not only enhanced the businessesâ€™ online presence but also offered a seamless user experience. The website was designed with both functionality and aesthetics in mind, using modern web development tools to ensure smooth navigation and responsive design. We employed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and dynamic site, with features like product pages, contact forms, and a user-friendly layout. The project allowed us to dive into the real-world application of website development, focusing on business needs such as customer engagement and marketing. The result was a polished, well-structured website that could be easily managed and updated by the business owners themselves, offering them a competitive edge in the digital world.</p>      </div>
