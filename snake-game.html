        <h4 class="h5">Technologies: Python, Reinforcement Learning, Neural Networks</h4>
        <p>Creating the Reinforcement Learning Snake Game was an exciting project that involved applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to a classic game. At the core of this game is Deep Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm that enables the AI to learn optimal strategies through trial and error. Initially, the AI starts by randomly making moves, but as it plays more games, it begins to learn the most efficient actions to take in order to maximize its score and survival time. The game environment is designed to simulate the classic Snake game mechanics, where the AI controls a snake that must eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. The AI uses a deep neural network to evaluate the state of the game, making decisions based on the current position of the snake, the location of food, and the surrounding obstacles. The model is trained over many iterations, adjusting its behavior based on the rewards and penalties it receives, ultimately leading to more efficient gameplay. The result is a dynamic and evolving game where the AI continuously improves its ability to navigate the environment, demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning in real-world applications. This project not only showcases the power of AI but also highlights the exciting possibilities for the future of gaming.</p>
