                <p class="normal-text">This is an AI-powered Snake game built using Deep Q-Learning to optimize movement and maximize survival. The game evolves over time as the AI learns the most efficient strategies to play and survive longer in the game.</p>
                <p class="normal-text">The goal of this project was to showcase the potential of reinforcement learning in gaming environments, where an AI agent continuously learns from its environment and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>
