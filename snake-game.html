                    <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <p>This is an AI-powered Snake game built using Deep Q-Learning to optimize movement and maximize survival. The game evolves over time as the AI learns the most efficient strategies to play and survive longer in the game.</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to showcase the potential of reinforcement learning in gaming environments, where an AI agent continuously learns from its environment and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</p>
